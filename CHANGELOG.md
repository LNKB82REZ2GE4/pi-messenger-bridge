# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Security
- Restricted DM admin commands (`/enable`, `/disable`, `/channels`, `/trusted`, `/revoke`, `/help`) to `adminUserId` only; trusted non-admin users can no longer run admin operations.
- Replaced challenge code generation from `Math.random()` to cryptographically secure `crypto.randomInt()`.
- Added strict validation for `/enable <chatId> <mode>` to reject invalid channel auth modes.
- Added deterministic admin backfill on config load and safe admin transfer behavior when revoking the current admin.

### Changed
- Replaced `latest` dependency specifiers for `@mariozechner/pi-ai`, `@mariozechner/pi-coding-agent`, and `@mariozechner/pi-tui` with explicit semver ranges (`^0.55.3`) for more predictable installs.

### Fixed
- Improved WhatsApp QR onboarding in TUI sessions by surfacing QR/status updates via `ctx.ui.notify` in addition to stdout logging.
- Preserved manual-connect QR mode across reconnect attempts so `/msg-bridge configure whatsapp` continues to emit QR codes until authenticated.
- Fixed WhatsApp debug-mode crash (`Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'child')`) by always passing a pino-compatible logger object to Baileys.
- Set WhatsApp browser signature dynamically from host OS (`Browsers.appropriate("Chrome")`) instead of Baileys' static macOS default.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-02-11

### Changed
- Package renamed from `pi-msg-bridge` to `pi-messenger-bridge` for better clarity
- Updated all repository URLs and documentation to reflect new package name
- Command remains `/msg-bridge` for brevity and ease of use

## [0.2.0] - 2026-02-11

### Added
- WhatsApp integration via Baileys library with QR code authentication
- Slack integration with Socket Mode support
- Discord integration with Message Content intent support
- Debug mode for troubleshooting (config.debug or MSG_BRIDGE_DEBUG env var)
- Non-blocking async transport initialization for faster startup
- Widget toggle command (`/msg-bridge widget`)
- Help command with full command reference
- Automatic invalid session cleanup (WhatsApp 401 handling)
- Session detection to prevent QR spam on startup

### Changed
- Renamed from "remote-pilot" to "msg-bridge" throughout codebase
- Command changed from `/remote` to `/msg-bridge`
- Config file moved from `~/.pi/msg-bridge/config.json` to `~/.pi/msg-bridge.json`
- WhatsApp auth directory: `~/.pi/msg-bridge-whatsapp-auth/`
- All debug output now behind debug flag (no spam by default)
- Status widget only shows connected transports
- Environment variables now override config file settings

### Security
- Config file permissions enforced: chmod 600 for files, 700 for directories
- Config directory permissions validated on startup with warnings
- WhatsApp auth directory created with secure permissions (700)
- Invalid WhatsApp sessions automatically cleared on 401 errors

### Fixed
- QR code display for WhatsApp (using qrcode-terminal instead of Baileys built-in)
- Tool call formatting now shows actual parameters instead of speculation
- Username extraction from WhatsApp messages
- Connection state tracking for accurate widget display
- Startup performance (transports load in background)

### Dependencies
- Added: @whiskeysockets/baileys, qrcode-terminal, @slack/bolt, discord.js
- Known vulnerabilities in transitive dependencies (node-telegram-bot-api, discord.js) - low impact for this use case

## [0.1.0] - 2026-02-10

### Added
- Initial MVP release
- Event-driven architecture using `pi.sendUserMessage()` and `turn_end` events
- Telegram bot integration with polling support
- Challenge-based authentication (6-digit codes)
- Trusted user management
- Admin commands for user and channel management
- Status widget showing connection status
- Commands: `/remote`, `/remote connect`, `/remote disconnect`, `/remote configure`
- Environment variable and file-based configuration
- Support for group chats with mention detection
- Channel authorization modes: all, mentions, trusted-only

### Security
- 6-digit challenge codes with 2-minute expiry
